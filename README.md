# Iterative-Deepening

Implement the uninformed search algorithm iterative deepening for this problem. 

This problem is a graph search problem, and the graph search version of iterative deepening should be used.

- The problem statement is in problem_statement.pdf.

- Problem:
You work as an engineer for the entrepreneur Melon Husk in his business that makes
electric semi-autonomous cars. The eventual goal of the business is to create an entirely
autonomous vehicle that is able to drive itself from one place to another safely and avoid
traffic jams. Your task is one part of the overall goal: to find efficient routes through cities
that avoid traffic jams. Which algorithm should you use?
The prototype system will be tested in Manhattan. The streets of Manhattan are
famously laid out on a grid. Suppose we have a grid with 15 streets running North-South,
and 15 streets running East-West, as in the picture below. The distance between two
adjacent intersections is the same throughout the grid.

- The file grids.txt contains five grids with different start and goal locations and traffic jams. The grids are represented as Java arrays filled with integers, where each integer represents one intersection. 0 means the intersection is clear, 1 represents a traffic jam, 2 represents the starting point, and 3 represents the goal.
