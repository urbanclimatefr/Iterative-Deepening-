# Iterative-Deepening

Implement the uninformed search algorithm iterative deepening for this problem. 

This problem is a graph search problem, and the graph search version of iterative deepening should be used.

This respository contains:
- The file grids.txt contains five grids with different start and goal locations and traffic jams. The grids are represented as Java arrays filled with integers, where each integer represents one intersection. 0 means the intersection is clear, 1 represents a traffic jam, 2 represents the starting point, and 3 represents the goal.
